Machine Learning for Linearly Separable Data

This repository contains a machine-learning model for working with linearly separable data. Linearly separable data is a fundamental concept in machine learning, where two or more classes of data can be perfectly separated by a linear decision boundary. This property makes it a crucial problem in many classification tasks.



Key Features:

Linear Classifiers: Explore a range of linear classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Perceptrons, ideal for handling linearly separable data.

Data Visualization: Visualize the linear separability of your dataset using intuitive plots and charts to gain a better understanding of your data.

Jupyter Notebooks: Get started quickly with Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step examples and explanations of linear separability concepts.

Sample Datasets: Use the sample dataset in the repository or apply your own data to see how these models work in practice.



Why Linear Separability Matters:

Linearly separable data often serves as a benchmark problem in machine learning, and understanding this concept is essential for building a strong foundation in the field. This repository provides a hands-on approach to working with linearly separable data and is a valuable resource for students, researchers, and machine learning enthusiasts.
